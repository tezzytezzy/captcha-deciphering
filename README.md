# captcha-deciphering

## Objective
Practical implementation of:
1. Convolutional Neural Network (Deep Learning) via [Keras](https://keras.io/), and
2. Web Data Mining via [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)*

*I mulled over [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) and [Selenium with Webdriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/), but settled on Beautiful Soup for its simplicity and ease of use.

## Installation
The following packages to be installed:

```bash
